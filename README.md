### Mini Notes
##### 1. Working with **Jupyter Notebook**

Notebook is a creative way of presenting your project outputs as it allows users to create documents (notebook) that contains codes, equations, and other visualizations all in one place.

  - Install ipykernel: `pip install ipykernel`
  - Adding virtual environment to jupyter: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<env_name>`
